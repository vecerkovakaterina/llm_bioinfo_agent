# Bioinformatics LLM Agent Playground

Welcome to the **Bioinformatics LLM Agent Playground!** This repository is a personal project where I experiment with integrating advanced Language Models (LLMs) and bioinformatics tools, running locally on a GPU.

## Overview

This project aims to create an intelligent agent that can assist with bioinformatics tasks by leveraging the power of LLMs. It's currently in the experimental phase, serving as a sandbox for testing new ideas and tools.

## Features

- **LLM integration**: Experimenting with state-of-the-are language models.
- **Bioinformatics Tools**: Implementing utilities for sequence analysis, functional analysis, and more.
- **GPU acceleration**: Utilization GPU for efficient model inference.

## Status

This project is in the early stages and is not ready for external use. It serves as a playground for learning and experimentation.
